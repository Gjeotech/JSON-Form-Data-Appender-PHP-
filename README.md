# JSON-Form-Data-Appender-PHP-
This is a simple PHP application that allows users to submit data through an HTML form and automatically store (or append) the entries into a JSON file (aployee_data.json). It demonstrates basic PHP form handling, validation, and file I/O (input/output) operations for lightweight data storage without using a traditional database.
